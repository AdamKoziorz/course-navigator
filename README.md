# course-navigator

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. This was supposed to be the "To Do List" project, the sixth project in the Full-stack Javascript course and the fourth project in the JavaScript course. However, I have decided to repurpose this website as a course navigator that will hold course links as well as Markdown notes.

This project tests SOLID principles and design patterns, as well as mastery of prior HTML/CSS/JS knowledge. I have decided to also include some tests.
