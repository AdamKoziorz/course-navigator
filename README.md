# odin-to-do-list

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "To Do List" is the sixth project in the Full-stack Javascript course and the fourth project in the JavaScript course. This project tests SOLID principles and design patterns, as well as mastery of previous JavaScript knowledge.

I have designated this assignment as my first resume piece due to its ability to showcase great software development principles as well as effective and simplistic UI/UX design.
